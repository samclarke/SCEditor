# Ideas for the future

## Spell checker plugin

It should:

   * Be generic so it can work with any contentEditable/designMode element and if possible any textarea too.
   * Have it's own repository instead of using the SCEditor one.
   * Allow multiple spell checker backends so PHP, Ruby, ASP.NET, Python, ect. can be used as well as web API's.
   * Get a list of unique words and check them and cache the result.
   * Have option for AYT spell checking with x seconds delay.
   * Grab previous words around range and also have manual spell check button.
   * Wrap the wrong words in a span with a class so it can have custom styling.
   * When the span is clicked/right clicked it should show a menu with suggestions, might want to preload them in case it's being done via AJAX.
   * Have an option to allow adding words so backends that support adding words can add them.
   * Have an ingore word option which adds the word to the cache.
   * Have options to ignore capitalised words, split words with hyphens.
   * Have an option to set a custom word handler which is passed a string to extract the words from.
   * Have an option to replace all words spelled a certain way with the suggested word.

**Possible check format:**

	{
		words: [
			"teh",
			"quick",
			"brown",
			"fox"
		]
	}

**Possible return format:**

	{
		 // Would be set to a string to show the user if an error occurs.
		errors: null

		// Assoc array with the key being the word and the value being an array of suggestions.
		// Suggestions array can be empty if there are none.
		corrections: [
			"teh": [
				"the",
				"ten"
			]
		]
	}
