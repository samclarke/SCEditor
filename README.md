## Usage

Include the SCEditor JavaScript:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="minified/themes/default.min.css" />
<script src="minified/sceditor.min.js"></script>
```

Then to convert a textarea into SCEditor, simply do:

```js
var textarea = document.getElementById('id-of-textarea');

sceditor.create(textarea, {
	format: 'xhtml',
	style: 'minified/themes/content/default.min.css'
});
```

or for a BBCode WYSIWYG editor do:

```js
var textarea = document.getElementById('id-of-textarea');

sceditor.create(textarea, {
	format: 'bbcode',
	style: 'minified/themes/content/default.min.css'
});
```

Finally, to get the contents of the editor:

```js
var textarea = document.getElementById("id-of-textarea");

sceditor.instance(textarea).val();
```


## Options

For a full list of options, see the [options documentation](http://www.sceditor.com/documentation/options/).



## Building and testing

You will need [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed to run the build/tests. To install Grunt run:

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Next, to install the SCEditor dev dependencies run:

```bash
npm install
```

That's it! You can now build and test SCEditor with the following commands:

```bash
# Minify the JS and convert the LESS to CSS
grunt build

# Run the linter, unit tests and coverage
grunt test

# Creates the final distributable ZIP file
grunt release
```

You can also run the dev server to test changes without having to do a full
build by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

and then going to http://localhost:9000/tests/
